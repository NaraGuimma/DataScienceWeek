# DataScienceWeek

This project was developed during the Data Science Week. It was an introduction to data science and prediction models using python.

Bellow are the steps to reproduce the same results:

1st- go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and run DataScienceWeek.ipynb. Based on jupiter notebook, it was used the folowing python libraries: pandas, Scikit- learn, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy to analyze  
Four models were evaluated: baseline, linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest resgressition. 
None parameters were included in the models. Randon Forest showed the best fit. 
The chosen dataset was Boston House Orices

2nd- after exporting 'data.cav', make sure you have Pyhton dowloaded in your machine, open VSCode (add pyhton and code runner extensions to it). Intall streamlit (pip install streamlit)
Type **streamlit run app.py** 

3rd- start making prediction based on random forest regression model.
