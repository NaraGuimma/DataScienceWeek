# DataScienceWeek

This project was developed during the Data Science Week. It was an introduction to data science and prediction models using python.

Bellow are the steps to reproduce the same results:

1st- go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and run DataScienceWeek.ipynb. Import the folowing libraries: pandas, Scikit- learn, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy to analyze to Jupiter Notebook.  
Four models were evaluated: baseline, linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest resgressition. 
None parameters were included in the models and even though, Random Forest showed the best results. 
The chosen dataset was Boston House Prices.

2nd- after exporting 'data.csv', make sure you have Pyhton dowloaded in your machine, open VSCode (add pyhton and code runner extensions to it). Intall streamlit (**pip install streamlit**)

Type **streamlit run app.py** 

3rd- start making predictions based on random forest regression model.
